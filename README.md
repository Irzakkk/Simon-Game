# Simon-Game
This repository contains a web-based implementation of the classic Simon game using HTML, CSS, and jQuery. The Simon game is a memory-based electronic game where players are challenged to repeat a sequence of colors and sounds generated by the game.

Game Features
The game consists of four colorful buttons, each representing a different sound and color: red, green, blue, and yellow.
The game generates a random sequence of colors and sounds, which the player must remember and repeat.
The game starts with a sequence of one color and progressively increases in difficulty as the player successfully completes each round.
The player can repeat the sequence by clicking on the buttons in the correct order.
Each time the player successfully repeats the sequence, the game adds one additional color to the end of the sequence.
If the player makes a mistake and clicks the wrong button or clicks the buttons in the wrong order, the game ends and the player has the option to start a new game.
The game keeps track of the player's highest score (number of rounds completed) and displays it on the screen.
The game provides audio and visual feedback for correct and incorrect button clicks.
Technologies Used
HTML: The structure of the game interface is created using HTML.
CSS: The game's visual styling and layout are defined using CSS.
jQuery: jQuery is used to handle user interactions, generate random sequences, and control the game logic.
JavaScript: Additional JavaScript is used for game functionality, such as playing sounds and updating the score.
